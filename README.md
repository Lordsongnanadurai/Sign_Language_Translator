# Sign-Language-Recognition-Using-Python-and-OpenCV

* There have been several advancements in technology and a lot of research has been done to help the people who are deaf and dumb.
* Aiding the cause, Deep learning, and computer vision can be used too to make an impact on this cause.
* This can be very helpful for the deaf and dumb people in communicating with others as knowing sign language

## Project Overview
* In this sign language recognition project, I've created a sign detector, which detects numbers from 1 to 10 that can very easily be extended to cover a vast multitude of other signs and hand gestures including the alphabets.
* I have developed this project using OpenCV and Keras modules of python.
